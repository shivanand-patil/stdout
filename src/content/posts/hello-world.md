# Hello World

Welcome to **stdout.shivoncall.com** - my digital garden where I share thoughts, logs, and scripts.

## What to expect

This blog will be a collection of:
- Technical thoughts and discoveries
- Code snippets and scripts
- Logs from my development journey
- Random musings about technology

## Why "stdout"?

In Unix-like systems, `stdout` (standard output) is where programs send their normal output. This blog is my stdout - where I redirect my thoughts and experiences for the world to see.

```bash
echo "Hello, World!" > stdout
```

Stay tuned for more content coming soon!
